# ghost-game
This is a rough console application (as well as my first ever independent coding project) which currently only functions to manage a mostly human-controlled DND-type game played between my friends and I.

I will be building onto this project gradually while I learn other skills, but I hope to possibly turn this into something much larger much further into the future.
